# Rivnet project 

## Code and R data repository for the Harvey and Altermatt XX article

### Repository structure:
- `data`: Raw data (empty see 'Important notice below')
- `scripts`: R scripts (**see below for a description**)
- `R`: Custom R functions called by the main code from the `scripts` folder
- `doc`: Documents that are not generated by the R code 
- `figs`: Figures generated by the code
- `output`: Documents generated by the code other than figures (tables, data files)

### Scripts order: 
The scripts have to be run in a specific order to run properly
- 1- Rivnet_DatMan.R (**this script cannot be run - 'Important notice' below**)
   - input: Raw data
   - output: Data for ordination
- 2- Rivnet_ORD.R
   - input: Data for ordination
   - output: Data for SEM
- 3- Rivnet_SEM.R
   - input: Data for SEM
   - output: SEM results

Rivnet_TimeBxplot can be used in any order. It will generate a simple boxplot figure to investigate the effect of 'sampling year' on patterns. 

**Please note**
Unfortunately because of copyright issues we were not allowed to include the original data from the Swiss BioDiversity Monitoring program (`data` folder empty). This means that all data available (see `output` folder) folder are pre-processed information from the original data and that the Rivnet_DatMan.R script is here for information purpose only but will not run properly. Inquiries to obtain the original raw data can be made directily to the BDM organization: http://www.biodiversitymonitoring.ch/en/home.html
